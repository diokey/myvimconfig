myvimconfig
===========
This repo contains my current VIM set up to provide full featured IDE for Web development.

It supports IDE feautures like 

* autocompletion
* codesnippet
* code analysis
* code folding / unfolding
* autoclosing for (),[],{},'',""

I'm currently using it for development of pretty much everything

The following list of languages and technology is currently fully supported by this configuration but can be extended to fit your needs

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Node.js
* Angular.jus 
* JQuery
* Jasmine


It requires bundle to be installed before actually clone this .vimrc file.

To install bundle follow these instructions :


https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim


Once bundle is installed just clone this repo and type in vim :PluginInstall to install all the plugns.

git clone https://github.com/diokey/myvimconfig.git .


Then open vim, and simply type :PluginInstall

It will download and install all the plugins i'm using now...


I'll list the plugins i'm using very soon....

If you run into an issue, just let me know ;)
