My Vim IDE set up
-----------------
-----------------

My current VIM set up to provide full featured IDE for Webdevelopment.

It requires bundle to be installed before actually clone this .vimrc file.

To install bundle follow these instructions :


https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim


Once bundle is installed just clone this repo and type in vim :PluginInstall to install all the plugns.

git clone https://github.com/diokey/myvimconfig.git .


Then open vim, and simply type :PluginInstall

It will download and install all the plugins i'm using now...


I'll list the plugins i'm using very soon....

If you run into an issue, just let me know ;)
