My Vim IDE set up
-----------------
-----------------

My current VIM set up to provide full featured IDE for Webdevelopment.

It requires bundle to be installed before actually clone this .vimrc file.

Once bundle is installed just clone this repo and type in vim :PluginInstall to install all the plugns.


I'll list the plugins i'm using very soon....
